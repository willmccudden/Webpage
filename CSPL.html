		<p> <h4>15th Nov 2020</h4>
			This weekend I've decided to start learning HTML, I've watched a 2 hour
			tutorial on youtube and now understand all the basics, I've been able
			to create a very basic website with three pages.The 'Homepage' gives a
			brief description of me and this website. The 'Computer Science Progress Log' page
			is where I will log all progress I make with this website and other
			computer science projects finally, the Sudoku Tool page, where I want to
			add the sudoku solver that I have made in my free time. I have no idea how
			to do this yet. The website is in very basic HTML format, as shown in the picture.
			Next I plan to learn CSS to make it look nicer. Once the website looks more
			presentable I'm planning to get rent a domain name and host the website with godaddy.
