						Welcome to Will's Website, I'm a 22 year old computer science and maths
						graduate from Somerset/Birmingham. I've built this webpage in a quest to learn HTML,
						CSS and Javascript after graduating to improve my chances of finding
						work. I plan to include a log of all the work I'm doing whilst unemployed
						and also include those projects on this website. I have previous experience
						In java and C++ from my MSc in Computer Science
